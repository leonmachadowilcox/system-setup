# Dotfiles Bootstrap

This repository contains my personal dotfiles and a system setup script that can quickly configure a new machine (macOS or Linux) with the same environment.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Clone the repo using GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh repo clone <your-username>/dotfiles-bootstrap ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./setup.sh --make-zsh-default
